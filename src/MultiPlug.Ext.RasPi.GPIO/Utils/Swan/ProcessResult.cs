/// Repeating code and reinventing the wheel is generally considered bad practice. 
/// At Unosquare we are committed to beautiful code and great software. Swan is a 
/// collection of classes and extension methods that we (and other good developers)
/// have written and evolved over the years. We found ourselves copying and pasting
/// the same code for every project every time we started them. We decided to kill
/// that cycle once and for all. This is the result of that idea. Our philosophy is 
/// that Swan should have no external dependencies, it should be cross-platform, 
/// and it should be useful.
